The Magic Buttob widget will be available in Elementor items. Just drag it to your website and select the customization options :)

You can also use dthe shortcode to display the portfolio grid on a page/post, or using Gutenberg and other page builders:

[magic-button link="'.$linkurl.'" target="'.$target.'" nofollow="'.$nofollow.'" align="'.$align.'" style="'.$style.'" text="'.$text.'" icon="'.$iconvalue.'" icon_position="'.$icon_align.'" size="'.$size.'"]

You can customize it using these options:

* **link:** Set the link of the button (eg: link="http://wordpress.org").
* **target**: You can use it to open the link in a new window. Options: true/false.(eg: target="true").
* **nofollow**: Use it to set the link as "nofollow". Options: true/false (eg: nofollow="true").
* **align**: The aligment of the button. Options: center/left/right. (eg: align="center").
* **style**: The hover effect of the button. Options: see https://pwrplugins.com/magic-buttons-for-elementor-addon-and-widget-plugin-demo/. (eg: style="nina").
* **size**: Size of the button. Options: sm/md/lg (eg: size="lg").
